			<p>Fosscord is a Discord server reimplementation and extension. </p>

			<p>
				Essentially, we provide all the functions and services that Discord does, which allows software built
				for Discord such as clients, bots, and other applications to work seemlessly with Fosscord. We also
				implement custom server features to enhance the experience and provide additional functionality.
			</p>

			<p>
				What this means for you is that you can continue to use the programs you're already familiar with, all
				while using a safe, privacy focused platform to chat with friends which <i>you</i> control.</p>

			<p>
				<b style="display: block">It does <u>not</u> mean that users of Fosscord can interact with users of Discord.</b>
				We are entirely separate platforms, and your Fosscord account cannot be used to interact with Discord. In the future, we
				hope to develop our own clients and tools to allow you to use multiple accounts at the same time, but
				this is not yet being worked on.

                Because we benefit from the large user base of discord, thus more
                users, making the switch easier for new users & keeping workflows
                intact.
              </li>
              <li>
                No disadvantage for the users who use fosscord, so that they can
                still communicate with all their peers who use discord.
              </li>
              <li>
                Discord has already built a great and stable protocol (don't
                reinvent the wheel).
              </li>
              <li>
                The community can extend and customize their clients and servers
                by selfhosting them and developing and installing addons

          <div class="mt-1 mb-35 f-22 color-heading text-adaptive description">
            Spacebar aims to be a reimplementation of Discord, adding more
            features that can be used as a replacement for the official client,
            still connect to discord.com, and host private Spacebar server
            instances.<br /><br />

            Spacebar aims to give the best possible user experience, while being
            backwards compatible to Discord's features and adding new
            ones/improving old ones while maintaining the user privacy with
            end-to-end encryption support.<br /><br />
            The client can connect to multiple server instances without the need
            to open it multiple times.<br />
            The client will be customizable through a secure Plugin and Theme
            System with it's own marketplace. The server will be customizable
            through bots, just like discord without the need to change anything
            except the API endpoint.
            <br /><br />
            The project is open source so everyone can have a look what's going
            on under the hood and can be maintained and expanded by the
            community. Everything is configurable in the server config and
            everyone can add their own features, so that it is not biased.

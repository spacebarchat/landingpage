					<h3>Free and Open Source</h3>
					<p>
						We believe the best way to make software is through easy and open public contribution.
						Spacebar Chat is 100% open source, and is licensed under the
						<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General Public License v3.0</a>
					</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://github.com/spacebarchat/server">Github</a>
				</div>

				<div class="feature done">
					<h3>Configurable</h3>
					<p>
						Spacebar has a large number of configurable values to determine every aspect of how your
						instance operates. If an option you need doesn't exist, you do always have the option to simply
						edit the source too!
					</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://docs.spacebar.chat/setup/server/configuration/">Configuration documentation</a>
				</div>

				<div class="feature done">
					<h3>Many supported DB engines</h3>
					<p>
						Instance owners have complete control over which DBMS software they use as a backend to
						Spacebar.
					</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://docs.spacebar.chat/setup/server/database/">Database documentation</a>
				</div>

				<div class="feature done">
					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
						Spacebar has a number of security features built in, such as instance-wide user rights.
						Rights are kind of like guild member permissions, except for the entire instance,
						for example the right to send messages or to create bot accounts.
					</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://docs.spacebar.chat/setup/server/security/rights/">Rights documentation</a>
				</div>

				<div class="feature incomplete">
					<h3>E2E Encryption</h3>
					<p>We believe communication should be private. End to End Encryption is a planned, core feature of
						Spacebar, and will allow users to truly trust that their privacy, and private information is
						kept from prying eyes. It should be noted that, without client support for this feature, you
						will be unable to send/receive encrypted messages.
					</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://github.com/spacebarchat/server/issues/322">Tracker</a>
				</div>

				<div class="feature incomplete">
					<h3>Discord.com Compatibility</h3>
					<p>Spacebar aims to be 100% compatible with existing discord.com clients, bots, and other services,
						as well as any that appear in the future. This allows a smooth transition from Discord.com to a
						Fosscord instance. With this goal also comes complete feature parity between Discord.com and
						Fosscord. We aim to have all Discord.com features implemented within Spacebar, as well as
						additional features and configurability given to our users.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="feature incomplete">
					<h3>Server Plugins</h3>
					<p>Through Spacebar server plugins, instance owners will be able to easily extend and add new
						features to their instances.
					</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://github.com/spacebarchat/server/pull/837">Tracker</a>
				</div>
        
        	<div class="feature incomplete">
					<h3>Not only chat</h3>
					<p>As Spacebar is open source, anyone can use it for any purpose. It does not have artificial
          restrictions that prevent it from being used in usecases that are not casual friends&family or
          fans conversation. In fact, the more institutions use Spacebar as their preferred instant
          messaging and real time communication solution, the more chance our bugs get noticed and 
          possibly the sooner they get fixed.	</p>
					<em>Essay coming soon</em>
				</div>

				<div class="feature incomplete">
					<h3>Voice and Video</h3>
					<p>Voice and Video support on Spacebar is in active development, but may take a while longer.</p>
					<a class="moreInfo" href="https://github.com/spacebarchat/server/pull/472">Tracker</a>
				</div>

				<div class="feature">
					<h3>Much more!</h3>
					<p>This is <i>by no means</i> a complete list of features, planned or completed, that the team
						behind
						Spacebar wishes to implement. We already have a large number of features implemented and working
						using existing discord.com clients, and have no plans on stopping.</p>
